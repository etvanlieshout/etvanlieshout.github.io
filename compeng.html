<h1>Computer Engineering</h1>

	<p>
	<b>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</b>: My interests in computing are in systems and infrastructure generally. I
	started by learning about how computers implement basic arithmetic circuits, moved
	to basic CPU and system architecture, then operating systems, and am beginning to
	learn about networking and distributed systems, with virtualization and
	containerization technologies slated for future studies.
	</p>
	<p>From the 
	<a href="https://eater.net/">Ben Eater 8-bit CPU build</a> and the 
	<a href="https://etvanlieshout.github.io/vic-20.html">Commodore VIC-20</a>
 	to modern operating systems, 
	SOC microcontrollers, and beyond to networking, virtualization, and distributed computing, 
	taking the time to start from the basic principles of computing and slowly building up knowledge of 
	increasingly complex systems is, I believe, the best way to get a deep understanding and appreciation
	of how the massive, complex global computing infrastructure is built up from simple zeros and ones.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have a lot still to learn and I am by no means an expert in any one of the fields I've studied, 
	but I feel confident that I have a sufficiently strong grasp of the fundementals that 
	I can build out my knowledge as required by both professional and personal endeavors.
