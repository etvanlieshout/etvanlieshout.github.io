	<h1>Commodore .PRG files on the VIC-20</h1>
	<h2>WORK IN PROGRESS</h2>
	<p>
		A breakdown and guide to the Commodore .PRG file format, and creating and running prg files on the VIC-20.
	</p>
	<p>
		Commodore's <code>.prg</code> filetype is a simple executable file format used in the PET,
		VIC-20, C64, and C128. It is a simple (BASIC?) format, but the details of how a <code>.prg</code>
		file is implemented on a particular Commodore system as well as what the file format can and
		cannot do require some elaboration.
	</p>
	<br></br>
	<h2>Anatomy of a PRG File</h2>
	<p>
		<b>HEADER + PROGRAM</b><br>
		The gross anatomy of a Commodore <code>.prg</code> file is a two-byte header followed by 
		the sequence of bytes that comprise the body of the program.
	</p>
	<p><b>HEADER</b>: The two-byte header designates
		the memory location into which the program is to be loaded. This location is almost always
		designated to be the start of the user's BASIC program RAM space. For the VIC-20 that address 
		is 0x1001 (while the system's user RAM starts at 0x1000, for some reason these first bytes 
		create issues, hence starting one byte into the user RAM space). 
		When loading the program into main memory, the system skips the header and only 
		loads the program byte sequence into memory starting at the designated memory location.
	</p>
	<p><b>PROGRAM</b>: The program itself in the <code>.prg</code> is a tokenized BASIC program, but by
		using the SYS command the program can contain and run 6502 machine code. Thus a <code>.prg</code>
		 executable can be either a BASIC program, a 6502 assembly program (paired with a 1-line
		BASIC launch program), or a mix (using SYS to move from executing BASIC code to machine code and
		calling the kernel subroutine for parsing tokenized BASIC to move from executing machine
		code to BASIC code).
	</p>
	<p>
		Once loaded, the <code>.prg</code> program can be run by typing <code>RUN</code> into the 
		system BASIC interpreter. <!--The program itself can either be a BASIC program or a 6502 assembly 
		program, or a mix (and in fact, an assembly program requires a small BASIC launch program)-->
	</p>

	<h2>Anatomy of an Assembly Program</h2>
	<p>Here is a breakdown of the hello-world.prg program produced by the simple
	   <a href="https://etvanlieshout.github.io/vic-20/vic-20-hello-world.html">Hello World program</a>
	   on this site. <br>NOTE: All 2-byte/ multi-byte values (e.g., for addresses) are in Little Endian format.

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Header</b>: The first two bytes <code>01 10</code> are the header, designating the memory address into which
		the program will be loaded. Little-Endian format. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>BASIC Launch Program</b>: The next 14 bytes comprise a short BASIC program (tokenized) that launches
		the machine language portion of the program. Adding these bytes to the beginning of a 6502 assembly
		source code file effectively inserts this program at the start of your <code>.prg</code> file. 
		This 1-line BASIC program breaks down as follows:<br> <!--insert bytes here-->
		<code>BASIC:  10 SYS 4111</code><br>
                <code>BYTES:  0d10 0a00 9e28 3431 3131 2900 0000 </code>
		<!-- TABLE -->
		<table border="1px solid black">
			<tr>
				<td><code>0x0d10</code></td>
				<td><code>0x0a00</code></td>
				<td><code>0x9e</code></td>
				<td><code>0x283431313129</code></td>
				<td><code>0x00</code></td>
				<td><code>0x0000</code></td>

				<td><code>Pointer to addr of next BASIC line</code></td>

				<td><code>Zero byte indicates end of current BASIC line</code></td>

			</tr>
		</table><br>
		This one-line program <code>10 SYS 4111</code> tells the VIC-20 to being executing
		6502 machine code starting at the address 4111, which is 0x100F. Consider that this BASIC
		program begins at the address 0x1001 and comprises 14 bytes, ending at address 0x100E. This
		means that the 6502 machine code begins as the next byte, 0x100F, which corresponds exactly
		to our <code>SYS 4111</code> call. In this way, we have successfully switched from executing a
		BASIC program to a 6502 machine language program.
