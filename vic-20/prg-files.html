		A breakdown and guide to the Commodore .PRG file format, and creating and running prg files on the VIC-20.

	<h3>Anatomy of a PRG file</h3>
	<p>
		Commodore's <code>.prg</code> filetype is a simple executable file format used in the PET,
		VIC-20, C64, and C128. It is a simple (BASIC?) format, but the details of how a <code>.prg</code>
		file is implemented on a particular Commodore system as well as what the file format can and
		cannot do require some elaboration.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>HEADER + PROGRAM</b><br>
		The gross anatomy of a Commodore <code>.prg</code> file is a two-byte header followed by 
		the sequence of bytes that comprise the body of the program. The two-byte header designates
		the memory location into which the program is to be loaded. This location is almost always
		designated to be the start of the user's BASIC program RAM space. For the VIC-20 that address 
		is 0x1001 and for the C64 0x8001 (while these systems' user RAM starts at 0x1000 and 0x8000,
		respectively, for some reason these first bytes create issues, hence starting one byte into the
		user RAM space). When loading the program into main memory, the system skips the header and only 
		loads the program byte sequence into memory starting at the designated memory location.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once loaded, the <code>.prg</code> program can be run by typing <code>RUN</code> into the 
		system BASIC interpreter. The program itself can either be a BASIC program or a 6502 assembly 
		program, or a mix (and in fact, an assembly program requires a small BASIC launch program)
