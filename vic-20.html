        But retro computing can be difficult to get into. Much of the
        retro computing information is understandably by and for enthusiasts
        already familiar with the basics (BASICs? - haha pun) of their
        platforms, or the guides available are from the 1980s and utilize
        tools not always readily available today (eg. a VICMON cart).

        This guide to working with the Commodore VIC-20 exists as a place for
        me to organize and store all the things I learn about how the VIC-20
        works, how to program it, etc. This guide is more for me than anything
        else, but I'm putting online in the case it can be of help to others.

        to get into, as it is often difficult to find beginner-friendly guides
        (at least I couldn't find them; perhaps it's just the poverty of my
        Google-Fu skills). With this guide, my aim is to put together some
        documents
