        Playing with 8-bit computers is fun!
        <!--
        But retro computing can be difficult to get into. Much of the
        retro computing information is understandably by and for enthusiasts
        already familiar with the basics (BASICs? - haha pun) of their
        platforms, or the guides available are from the 1980s and utilize
        tools not always readily available today (eg. a VICMON cart).

        Retro computing can be difficult
        to get into, as it is often difficult to find beginner-friendly guides
        (at least I couldn't find them; perhaps it's just the poverty of my
        Google-Fu skills). With this guide, my aim is to put together some
        documents

        This guide to working with the Commodore VIC-20 exists as a place for
        me to organize and store all the things I learn about how the VIC-20
        works, how to program it, etc. This guide is more for me than anything
        else, but I'm putting online in the case it can be of help to others.
