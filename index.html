<h1>Eric VanLieshout</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my personal & professional website</h2>
<h4>About Me</h4>
	<p>
	I am a student working on a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at
	the University at Buffalo (SUNY).<br>
	I am also a late-stage PhD candidate in English Literature (also at UB) completing 
	a dissertation project on the intersection of literature and science.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</b>: My interests in computing are in systems and infrastructure generally. I
	started by learning about how computers implement basic arithmetic circuits, moved
	to basic CPU and system architecture, then operating systems, and am beginning to
	learn about networking and distributed systems, with virtualization and
	containerization technologies slated for future studies.
	</p>
	<p>From the 
	<a href="https://eater.net/">Ben Eater 8-bit CPU build</a> and the 
	<a href="https://etvanlieshout.github.io/vic-20.html">Commodore VIC-20</a>
 	to modern operating systems, 
	SOC microcontrollers, and beyond to networking, virtualization, and distributed computing, 
	taking the time to start from the basic principles of computing and slowly building up knowledge of 
	increasingly complex systems is, I believe, the best way to get a deep understanding and appreciation
	of how the massive, complex global computing infrastructure is built up from simple zeros and ones.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have a lot still to learn and I am by no means an expert in any one of the fields I've studied, 
	but feel confident that I have a sufficiently strong grasp of the fundementals that 
	I can build out my knowledge as required by both professional and personal endeavors.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>ENGLISH LITERATURE</b>: My interests in English Literature, and more broadly
	literature and philosophy, are difficult to summarize. <!--Fundementally, reflective 
	critical discourse about the human condition is indispensible to human culture
	(at least, this is my belief), and the particular strength of literature, philosophy,
	history, and their neighboring fields lie precisely in their ability to inquire about
	and discuss the human condition in non-scientific modes.-->
	The particular strength I see in literature, philosophy,
	history, and their neighboring fields lies precisely in their ability to inquire about
	and discuss the human condition in non-scientific modes. Thus, much of my interest in
	literature, philosophy, and history stems from <!--in their different perspectives,-->
	their abilities to articulate different but equally fundemental aspects of the human condition.
	</p>
	<p>
	What this translates to as an academic or scholarly project is more nebulous.
	The short answer would be that I am interested in exploring the ways literature
	and philosophy are complementary to scientific understanding, since literature,
	philosophy, and science all have the same ultimate source (i.e., the human mind).
	The long answer would be best saved for a designated webpage (forthcoming?), 
	not an introductory "about me" section.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>WEB DESIGN</b>: As might be obvious, I am a fan of very basic websites that
	deliver information in a simple, robust format that will work on nearly any
	system with any connection. Fancy websites are neat, just clearly not my style :)
	</p>

<!--<p>This website serves as my general "about me" internet presence. It contains information 
about professional and personal projects related to both programs, alongside work related 
to any of my other interests.</p>-->
