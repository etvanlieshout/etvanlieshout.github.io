<h5>Under Construction</h5>
<br></br>

<p>I am a PhD candidate in English Literature at the University at Buffalo 
   (SUNY); I am also working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer
	 Engineering.</p>

<p>This website will serve as my general "about me" internet presence. 
   It will contain information about professional and personal
   projects related to both programs, alongside other work related to any of my
   other interests.</p>
